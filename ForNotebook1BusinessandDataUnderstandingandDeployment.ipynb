    "Online news publishers now have access to detailed metrics about the popularity of individual posts,  from page views to the amount of seconds a user spends reading a story. In particular, 'shares', the number of times each story is shared on social media, gives a very direct and exact measure of popularity. This could therefore be used to predict the future popularity of any particular story.\n"

Given our findings on the importance of links to other popular articles and keywords shared with other popular articles, they could either 'chase popularity' by sticking to these popular networks - or they could risk occasionally producing more innovative topics that might strike a chord with readers but might struggle algorithmically to generate shares, at least in the short term.\n",

    "Furthermore, although timing of publication and word count did not feature among the most influential features, in certain cases an editor might wish to look at them to judge which day and time to post a piece to reach the maximum audience possible (all other things being equal), so some further research into this might allow enable the deployment of such knowledge. \n",
